# Get Next Line (GNL)

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that **returns a line
ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.**

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
**"static variables"**

### Function Prototype
```c
int	get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
```
